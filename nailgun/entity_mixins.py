class Entity(object):
    """A logical representation of a Foreman entity.

    This class is rather useless as is, and it is intended to be subclassed.
    Subclasses can specify two useful types of information:

    * fields
    * metadata

    Fields are represented by setting class attributes, and metadata is
    represented by settings attributes on the inner class named ``Meta``. For
    example, consider this class declaration::

        class User(Entity):
            name = StringField()
            supervisor = OneToOneField('User')
            subordinate = OneToManyField('User')

            class Meta(object):
                api_path = 'api/users'

    In the example above, the class attributes of ``User`` are fields, and the
    class attributes of ``Meta`` are metadata. Here is one way to instantiate
    the ``User`` object shown above::

        User(
            name='Alice',
            supervisor=User(id=1),
            subordinate=[User(id=3), User(id=4)],
        )

    The canonical procedure for initializing foreign key fields, shown above,
    is powerful but verbose. As an alternative, the following convenience is
    offered:

        User(name='Alice', supervisor=1, subordinate=[3, 4])

    An entity object is useless if you are unable to use it to communicate with
    a server. The solution is to provide a :class:`nailgun.config.ServerConfig`
    when instantiating a new entity. This configuration object is stored as an
    instance variable named ``_server_config`` and used by methods such as
    :meth:`nailgun.entity_mixins.Entity.path`.

    1. If the ``server_config`` argument is specified, then that is used.
    2. Otherwise, if :data:`nailgun.entity_mixins.DEFAULT_SERVER_CONFIG` is
       set, then that is used.
    3. Otherwise, call :meth:`nailgun.config.ServerConfig.get`.
